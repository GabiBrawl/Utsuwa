## 13/12/25 - Repository organization and making of some assets - 1 hour
This is a test, and also I made this image to be the hero image for the GitHub repository of the project. This test is to see if I can get the project banner working in here, as I've been attaching pictures hosted in my GitHub repo instead of uploading them directly in here haha!

I also organized the repository files and made the BOM today.

## 12/12/25 - Speedrunning, from idea to finish in one day. - 13 hours

I decided to use the new RP2354A chip for the brains and swapped out the standard button for a Hall Effect Sensor. I can should be able to just a magnet to log in, which allows me to eventually seal the whole thing in waterproof epoxy. I added ESD protection as well, so the chip stays as safe as possible.

I began by researching the components I needed to assemble the circuitry correctly, then I designed the PCB and placed the components and only after that I routed and connected everything, this way I focused a bit more in the design of the key, making something which looks kinda nice, but not how imagined it... Idk how to do any better for now ):
